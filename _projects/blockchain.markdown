The goal of this program was to create a simplified block chain network using linked lists to record transactions on a distributed ledger. The block chain would record transactions between three of the schools at SMU, the Lyle School of Engineering, Cox School of Business, and Meadows School of the Arts, shown below is a visual of the network.
