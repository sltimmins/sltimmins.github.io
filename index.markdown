Previously, I have served as both a Junior Counselor and Instructor at an acclaimed summer camp called Camp Greenway, in northern Virginia. This experience taught me patience through listening to and entertaining thousands of questions at a time. I also learned valuable interpersonal skills working with such a wide variety of ages through the children, my co-workers, and superiors.

I also enjoy spending my free time working on cars and watching movies and TV, especially movies written and directed by Christopher Nolan. I am also a huge Star Wars and Marvel buff. I have spent the last few years building a Jeep Wrangler to conquer any trail I could throw at it and was lucky enough to get to test it to its limit in Moab, Utah a few summers ago. I am also in the process of a frame off restoration of a 1948 Willys Pickup with my father.
